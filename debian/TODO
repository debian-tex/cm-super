TODO for debian cm-super package:
---------------------------------
* Install the afm files also to /usr/share/texmf and only make links
  in /usr/X11R6
* Variants of sharp-s ß are present, how to make them available?
  There is a comment in README.Debian, but can we do something better?
* Do *not* recreate the pfb fonts und upgrade, only on new install!
  (carefull on major version changes!)
* defoma hints
  Check the auto generated hints file, and activate the dh_defomahints call
  in the rules file
