TODO for debian cm-super package:
---------------------------------
* Variants of sharp-s ß are present, how to make them available?
  There is a comment in README.Debian, but can we do something better?
* Do *not* recreate the pfb fonts und upgrade, only on new install!
  (carefull on major version changes!)
* check whether dependencies are correct for texlive on tfm/mf files, and
  should we recommend / suggest texlive-langcyrillic?
* when tetex has moved /etc/texmf/map to /u/s/texmf/fonts/map, we shold move
  the map files from /etc/texmf/fonts/map/dvips/cm-super to TEXMAIN, too.

  This has to be done carefully as we also have to be able to update from
  -2 version with map files in very old installations.
