TODO for debian cm-super package:
---------------------------------
* Variants of sharp-s ß are present, how to make them available?
  There is a comment in README.Debian, but can we do something better?
* Do *not* recreate the pfb fonts und upgrade, only on new install!
  (carefull on major version changes!)
