TODO for debian cm-super package:
---------------------------------
* Variants of sharp-s ß are present, how to make them available?
* Do *not* recreate the pfb fonts und upgrade, only on new install!
  (carefull on major version changes!)
* * lintian warning
W: cm-super: manpage-has-errors-from-man usr/share/man/man1/t1c2pfb.1.gz /tmp/zmanlAr6Jy:16: warning: can't find numbered character 243

* ev. depend on new package pfb2t1c2pfb, or at least recommend it, and if
  not present call the perl script

* install t1c2pfb.pl NOT as t1c2pfb, and fix man page, or take the one
  Ralf hopefully writes more complete.
