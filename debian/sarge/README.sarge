README for using cm-super fonts with teTeX 2, ie for sarge
----------------------------------------------------------

For those unfortunate that cannot use the teTeX3 backports together with
the normal backport of this package, this package is an alternative
which *should* work with the tetex2 packages in sarge.

If you find and problems, please contact me.
