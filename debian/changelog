cm-super (0.3.3-2) UNRELEASED; urgency=low

  * list all map files in updmap config file (Closes: #332670)
  * depend only on tex-common, making it impossible to install together
    with teTeX2. Add a README.teTeX2 for backporters. (Closes: #332673)
  * make font generation less noisy, only mention that it may take
    some time. (Closes: #333745)
  * include the postrm/postinst scripts from lmodern, which are prototypes
    of the Font Package part of the TeX Policy.
  * Install the afm files also to /usr/share/texmf and only make links
    in /usr/X11R6
  * Install defoma hints file
