cm-super (0.3.3-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * list all map files in updmap config file as MixedMap (Closes: #332670)
  * depend only on tex-common, making it impossible to install together
    with teTeX2. Add a README.teTeX2 for backporters. (Closes: #332673)
    This also closes the bug that cm-super-t1.map is left over in
    the updmap.cfg file (Closes: #334177)
  * make font generation less noisy, only mention that it may take
    some time. (Closes: #333745)
  * include the postrm/postinst scripts from lmodern, which are prototypes
    of the Font Package part of the TeX Policy.
  * Install the afm files also to /usr/share/texmf and only make links
    in /usr/X11R6
  * Install defoma hints file
  * The package name is cm-super now, so closes: #325093.
  * depend on tetex-(base|extra) | texlive-latexrecommended to get the
    mf sources and tfm files of the fonts.

cm-super (0.3.3-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Suggest pfb2t1c2pfb for binary conversion program. In the postinst

    perl script.

    cm-super: for the md5sum check
    cm-super source: old debian/postinst script is buggy, it is replaced
    cm-super-x11: install into X11R6
  * changed postinst, postrm to work with tetex2
  * Hack around that the pfb files are generated at install time and the
    md5sums are wrong if we ship empty files instead.
